HWdB:

Framework with menu and login handling for a SQL Server database with WPF MVVM as GUI. The database is for storage of hardware information. Developed with Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate. 
Open with Visual Studio, Run Debug and log in with username=admin and password=password.
Or run without Visaul Studio with HWdB.exe, like this:

Copy the following files to a folder on your computer:
HWdB.exe
HWdB.exe.config
EntityFramework.dll

Then click on HWdB.exe.

My intention is to some day complete this design but there is not timeplan for the completion.

Best regards, Gunnar Sir√©us
