LTB calculation application:

Windows 8 is preferred. Styling not perfectly adapted to Windows 7 and the UI looks strange and text is unreadable on some Windows 7 versions.

During installation an Icon is created on your desktop, "LTB Calculation". When you click on this Icon the program starts and you can log in with Username="admin" and Password="password". A database, HWdB.mdf, is created on your desktop. You can add users under "Administration". Thereafter, you can dimension LTB stocks with various input data. Each calculation is stored in the database for later use.
Developed with Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate.
